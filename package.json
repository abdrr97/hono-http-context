  "description": "The hono-http-context package is a lightweight and efficient library designed to provide context management for Hono.js applications, similar to how cls-hooked and express-http-context work for Node.js and Express applications. With hono-http-context, you can easily manage and share state across asynchronous operations within your Hono.js application, making it ideal for handling request-scoped data, user sessions, and more. This package ensures a seamless and straightforward way to propagate context throughout your app, improving code maintainability and simplifying complex workflows.",
